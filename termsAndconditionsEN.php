    <h2>LAST UPDATED: 1 JULY 2018</h2>
    <p>You can print a full copy of our Privacy and Data Protection Policy from your browser by pressing CTRL+P in Windows and Linux or ⌘+P from a Mac</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>PURAY, having its registered office at 75 St Nicholas Street Toronto, registered with the Paris Trade and Companies Register under the number B 572 034 361, publishes the website <u><strong><a href="http://www.puray.ca/"><span style="color:#000000;">www.puray.ca</span></a></strong></u> (the “Website”) which includes the processing and storage of data collected on or via the Website. PURAY has created this Privacy and Data Protection Policy (“Privacy Policy”) in order to communicate its policy and practices with regard to the collection, utilisation and disclosure of personally identifiable information relating to you that has been obtained via the Website.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>PURAY protects your privacy in compliance with current applicable regulations. PURAY, in its capacity as data controller, has thus notified the collection and processing of your personal data (the “Personal Data”) to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. It may be modified by PURAY at any time (see “Modifications and updates to the Privacy Policy”). The latest version of this Privacy Policy can be found on this page or by clicking on the “Privacy policy” link featured in the “Legal notices<strong>”</strong> section <strong>at the bottom</strong> of the Website’s home page.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you decide to use the Website, you are thereby agreeing to the collection, use and disclosure of personal and financial information by PURAY, under the conditions defined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept the terms of this Privacy Policy or any modifications made thereto, please leave the Website and do not purchase any PURAY products offered for sale on this Website.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>2. PURPOSE FOR WHICH YOUR DATA IS COLLECTED ON THE WEBSITE</h2>
    <p>Your Personal Data is collected either on the basis of your explicit consent or because it is necessary for the fulfilment of your orders (order fulfilment).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Your Personal Data is therefore collected in order to:</p>
    <ul>
	<li>answer any questions you may send using the “Contact Us” form;</li>
	<li>enable you to create a personalised “Your Account” space and thereby make on-line purchases;</li>
	<li>manage any orders placed on-line and their delivery as well as the applicable guarantees;</li>
	<li>ensure that on-line purchases are kept safe, to identify fraud and payment incidents;</li>
	<li>manage and optimise our customer relationship;</li>
	<li>subject to your consent: to send you information about our offers, news and events (newsletters, invitations, surveys and other publications);</li>
	<li>improve the way the Website works;</li>
	<li>offer personalised services;</li>
	<li>detect any potential cases of fraud;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>obtain statistical data.</li>
  </ul>

If you do not complete the required fields, PURAY will be unable to respond to your requests and/or provide you with the products and services requested. All other information is optional and enables us to get to know you better and to improve the communications and services we supply to you.</p>

	<li>your preferences and interests;</li>
	<li>technical data, particularly your IP address or navigation information relating to your terminal.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Required information that must be provided will be indicated by an asterisk during the collection process.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>4. RECIPIENTS OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
  <p>Your personal data is processed by PURAY. This data will not be transferred or made accessible to any third party other than (i) any potential PURAY subcontractors, for reasons relating to technical and logistical matters only (carriers, service providers for the hosting and maintenance of the Website, payment and fraud management service providers, etc.) all of whom have agreed to use that information solely in connection with the services that they provide to PURAY and (ii) following any reorganisation of our Company, including a total or partial asset sale, merger, absorption, acquisition, division and, more generally, any restructuring transaction.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your Personal Data may be accessible to other PURAY affiliates for customer relationship management and optimisation and also, with your consent, to send you details of our offers, news and events.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Finally, PURAY may disclose your Personal Data to third parties when required to do so by law, a regulatory provision or a court order, or if necessary to ensure the protection and defence of the company's rights.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>5. TRANSFER OF DATA ABROAD</h2>
  <p>The recipients of your Personal Data may be located abroad, including outside the European Economic Area and the United States. Any transfer of your Personal Data outside the European Economic Area and the United States is carried out subject to the provision of the appropriate guarantees, particularly contractual, in accordance with the applicable data protection regulation.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A copy of the guarantees enforced by PURAY can be obtained upon request from PURAY.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>6. RETENTION PERIOD</h2>
  <p>PURAY undertakes to use the Personal Data for the period of time necessary for the achievement of the purposes described above only.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Personal Data relating to you, collected and processed in the context of the “Contact Us” page, is stored for the period required to deal with your query only. It is then deleted.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The data relating to your orders is in principle stored by PURAY for no longer than the applicable legal period of limitation. This data will however remain available from your customer account for so long as this remains active. Immediately following the closure of your client account, this data (i) will be archived for accounting purposes and as evidence for as long as is permitted by the aforementioned periods of limitation or (ii) will be destroyed if such deadlines have expired.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your bank details will be stored securely for the length of time required to validate your order and for payment, and will then be immediately deleted. In the event of a payment incident, your data will be stored for the period required to resolve the incident, and then for a period of between three (3) and five (5) years depending on the level of seriousness of the incident.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The customer identification data used, with the consent of the customer, to send our newsletters and other PURAY publications, will be stored for a period of three years starting from their date of collection or from the last order placed by the customer (for example, a request for documentation or a click on a hypertext link contained in an email; however, the opening of an email shall not be considered as customer-initiated contact).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your customer account on the Website will remain active until such time as you may decide on its closure or for so long as you continue to make purchases via our Websites. Your account will be deactivated if inactive for more than three years.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At the end of this period of three years, PURAY may again contact the customer in question in order to discover if the latter wishes (i) to continue to receive newsletters and other publications from PURAY and/or (ii) to keep his or her customer account on the Website. Your data will moreover be destroyed within a maximum of two business days following receipt of an unsubscribe request from you.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The customer has under all circumstances a right to close his or her account and/or unsubscribe from newsletters at any moment. To do so, please contact our customer services department via email at <a href="mailto:service.fr@celine.com">service.fr@celine.com</a> or click on the unsubscribe link featured in each newsletter. To exercise this right, you may also complete the “contact” form provided on our Website describing your request and please also see the relevant part of our Frequently Asked Questions page.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Finally, the collection logs obtained via cookies and other trackers used on our Website will, subject to your approval, be stored in accordance with the applicable legislation for a term of no more than thirteen (13) months. Please see our cookies policy for further details.</p>
